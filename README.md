This repo is for CIS 4951 - Capstone II, Project: HOWRU.life app. Group work will be placed here. Good luck!

## Components
When creating pages in the components folder here are some things to keep in mind:
* Each page has its own folder within the components
* Specific components for a page should be in a folder within the page's folder.
* Components that are in many pages i.e. navigation menu should be within the GeneralComponents folder.
